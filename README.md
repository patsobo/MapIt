# MapIt

Homework #3 for my Android programming class.  Made by me, Patrick Sobolewski.

# Description

This app tracks locations the user visits and reports weather information about each of these points.  All points are displayed on a map.

# Usage

To run, connect an Android phone to your computer via USB.  With Android Studio installed, click the green 'Run' button at the top of the screen, and select your phone from the popup.

Once in the app, press the floating action button in the bottom right to save your current location.  Once this is done, the marker on the map will appear.  Click on it to get more information about that point, including its weather status.  To delete all points on the map, click the ellipsis menu (...) in the top right, and press "Clear History".

# Compiling

This code will be compiled as well by following the instructions above.  In Android Studio, you can also run Build -> Make Project.

# Notes

No bugs I can think of, those please email me at psobolew@mines.edu if any are found.
